Potentially cool Blender addon that randomly showed up on my Google feed.

I've been working on an add on for Godot, primarily to make things easier on myself, but I'm curious if anyone else would be interested in it.  It is a database manager system where you can create tables of data that can be used in your game, directly in Godot instead of Google sheets. It is not yet complete, but it works.

@DIO It is on GitHub.  There is no documentation and it is still buggy, but you are welcome to download the project files.  https://github.com/AwesomeUnicorn3/DBManager.git

@DIO All of the tables are imported as dictionaries.  You will need to set the "DBManager" script as autoload for it to work.

There is a table named "Table Data", in it you will let the system know if it will be part of the Dynamic database(the dictionary that will create the save file) or Static (Data that does not change) and what the reference name will be. These two dictionaries contain dictionaries as keys for each table.

 For exaple, If you want to reference a dynamic variable in your game code it would be DBManager.Dynamic_Game_Dict["Table Name"]["key Name]["Value Name"]

Does that make sense?

[reason: addon is nascent, author will re-post when ready]

does someone know about a good alternative to asset forge when we talk about easy modeling 3d models? i'm testing paint3d, it seems interesting, but i'm seeing for other options
other questions: beyond mixamo, are there (mainly free, but paid options will be accepted too) programs that animate 3d models too?

Mixamo doesn't animate the models, it's just a library of premade rigged meshes and animations. If you know your way around rigging and actually want to do your own animations, there's creature 3D that's  currently free while in alpha, Cascadeur free as long as you're earning less than 100k a year and Blender, covers the free ones. For paid you have the typical maya, 3dsmax, Cinema4D, Lightwave, Houdini and Akeytsu (which is a stand alone 3D animation suite that existed before Cascadeur came about). Otherwise you're either paying someone else to make the animations you want or continue to use Mixamo as a resource.

Would you like to learn making your own games? That starts with learning to code and to do that we need to learn about variables!
